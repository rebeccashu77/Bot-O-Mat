# Bot-O-Mat
Command-line application in Python that allows user to create new robots, assign them tasks, view the leaderboard, and save and load these robots upon reentry.

## To Run:
Have Python 3 installed

To enable playsound:

``` pip install pyobj --user ```

``` pip install playsound ```

To run:

run ``` python3 Welcome.py ```

## Overview

Your application should collect a name and robot type from the types we list below. For each, it should create a Robot of the type the user chooses, e.g. Larry, Bipedal. 

Given the list of tasks below, your application should then assign the Robot a set of five tasks, all of which complete after a duration that we show in milliseconds. 



- Collect a name and robot type from user.
- Instantiate a Robot of the type provided by the user with the name provided by the user
  - for example: Bipedal, Larry
- Set up methods on Robot to complete tasks from the provided list

## Robot
Robot completes tasks and removes them from the list when they are done (i.e. enough time has passed since starting the task).

## Tasks
Tasks have a description and an estimated time to complete.

  },{
    description: 'sweep the house',
    eta: 3000,
